# Cypress ✨
An informal introduction to testing with cypress.io

# What is Cypress? 🤔
```notes
Cypress is a testing tool that focuses on end-to-end testing, and achieves this
by tightly integrating itself with chrome. All tests are run on Chrome directly,
so you have access to everything that you would regularly have in the browser
and more!

## What kind of tests can I write?
* End-to-end
* Integration
* Unit
---
## What features does it offer?
* Time Travel
* Debuggability
* Automatic Waiting
* Spies, Stubs, and Clocks
* Network Traffic Control
* Consistent Results
* Screenshots and Videos

```notes
* Time Travel: Cypress takes snapshots as your tests run. Simply hover over commands in the Command Log to see exactly what happened at each step.
* Debuggability: Stop guessing why your tests are failing. Debug directly from familiar tools like Chrome DevTools. Our readable errors and stack traces make debugging lightning fast.
* Automatic Waiting: Never add waits or sleeps to your tests. Cypress automatically waits for commands and assertions before moving on. No more async hell.
* Spies, Stubs, and Clocks: Verify and control the behavior of functions, server responses, or timers. The same functionality you love from unit testing is right at your fingertips.
* Network Traffic Control: Easily control, stub, and test edge cases without involving your server. You can stub network traffic however you like.
* Consistent Results: Our architecture doesn’t use Selenium or WebDriver. Say hello to fast, consistent and reliable tests that are flake-free.
* Screenshots and Videos: View screenshots taken automatically on failure, or videos of your entire test suite when run from the CLI.
